# Goal
The goal of this project is to learn more about neural networks to eventually design my own projects. The code for this project follows the a series from Codemy.com on YouTube. The link to the series -> [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xp0LtPBcos0&list=PLCC34OHNcOtpcgR9LEYSdi9r7XIbpkpK1&index=6

## Whats Included
This repo contains two neural networks. 
- Starter Model: Simple model utilizing the iris dataset to predict classes of flowers.
- CNN Model: Utilizes MINST dataset to predict a number in range 0-9 based off a 32x32 image.
